\section{Possible Directions for Future Work}
\subsection{Modifications to the Force-Balance Magnetodisc Model}
- make more parameters LT dependent
- segment them into  smaller LT sectors once more data  is available to make it properly 3D
- pressure anistropy

\subsection{TBD title - periodicities}
- recent collaboration opportunities to continue working on equinox study using a combination of northern and southern periodicities

\subsection{TBD title - big picture}
- more large-scale, with the end of Cassini, more  people moving  to Jupiter. Juno may answer some questions, allow a comparison of the compressibility with more detail. JUICE.
