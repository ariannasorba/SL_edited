abstract = {Abstract The magnetometer data for the Cassini mission (2004–2016) are used to derive a model of Saturn's meridional magnetic field lines. Using a bin map of the Bρ and Bz field components, the field lines can be traced from the equator to high latitudes in the inner magnetosphere. The traces reveal a magnetic field greatly compressed on the dayside and highly elongated on the nightside, which are presumably the effects of solar wind compression and viscous flow around the magnetosphere. A model of the traced field lines can accommodate this day-night asymmetry and offer a way to connect various places in the magnetosphere. This model can be adjusted for magnetodisk warping by using solar latitude. The field line traces can be mapped down to the ionosphere using an offset dipole. The dayside magnetopause (L = 21) is mapped to colatitudes of ~13° in the north and ~16° in the south, while for L > 25 on the nightside, the mapped field lines approach asymptotic limits of ~16° in the north and ~18° in the south.}

abstract = {The first extended series of observations of Saturn's auroral emissions, undertaken by the Hubble Space Telescope in January 2004 in conjunction with measurements of the upstream solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) by the Cassini spacecraft, have revealed a strong auroral response to the interplanetary medium. Following the arrival of the forward shock of a corotating interaction region compression, bright auroras were first observed to expand significantly poleward in the dawn sector such that the area of the polar cap was much reduced, following which the auroral morphology evolved into a spiral structure around the pole. We propose that these auroral effects are produced by compression-induced reconnection of a significant fraction of the open flux present in Saturn's open tail lobes, as has also been observed to occur at Earth, followed by subcorotation of the newly closed flux tubes in the outer magnetosphere region due to the action of the ionospheric torque. We show that the combined action of reconnection and rotation naturally gives rise to spiral structures on newly opened and newly closed field lines, the latter being in the same sense as observed in the auroral images. The magnetospheric corollary of the dynamic scenario outlined here is that corotating interaction region-induced magnetospheric compressions and tail collapses should be accompanied by hot plasma injection into the outer magnetosphere, first in the midnight and dawn sector, and second at increasing local times via noon and dusk. We discuss how this scenario leads to a strong correlation of auroral and related disturbances at Saturn with the dynamic pressure of the solar wind, rather than to a correlation with the north-south component of the IMF as observed at Earth, even though the underlying physics is similar, related to the transport of magnetic flux to and from the tail in the Dungey cycle.}

abstract = {Abstract We investigate the structure of Jupiter's dawnside magnetopause using observations obtained by particle and fields instrumentation on the Juno spacecraft. Characterization of Jupiter's magnetopause is critical for the understanding of mass and energy transport between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. We find an extended magnetopause boundary layer (MPBL) during a magnetopause crossing on 14 July 2016. This thick MPBL, in combination with a large magnetic field component normal to the magnetopause boundary, suggests that strong magnetospheric compression enhances mass transport across the magnetopause via magnetic reconnection. We further identify ~2 h increases in the total magnetospheric pressure adjacent to the magnetopause on 14 July 2016 and 1 August 2016. These large-scale structures provide evidence of focused energy transport into the magnetosphere via magnetohydrodynamic structures.}

abstract="The international Cassini/Huygens mission consists of the Cassini SaturnOrbiter spacecraft and the Huygens Titan Probe that is targeted for entry into the atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, Titan. From launch on October 15, 1997 to arrival at Saturn in July 2004, Cassini/Huygens will travel over three billion kilometers. Once in orbit about Saturn, Huygens is released from the orbiter and enters Titan's atmosphere. The Probe descends by parachute and measures the properties of the atmosphere. If the landing is gentle, the properties of the surface will be measured too. Then the orbiter commences a four-year tour of the Saturnian system with 45 flybys of Titan and multiple encounters with the icy moons. The rings, the magnetosphere and Saturn itself are all studied as well as the interactions among them.",

abstract = {A three-dimensional (3-D) numerical magnetohydrodynamic model is used to investigate the temporal and spatial evolution of large-scale solar wind (SW) disturbances. A tilted dipole outflow configuration is specified at the inner boundary near the Sun, and a structured, corotating SW flow with a monopolar interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is established by dynamic relaxation between 0.14 and 1.04 AU. Time-dependent variation of the pressure and velocity at the inner boundary is applied to simulate injection of a coronal mass ejection (CME) near the streamer belt. In this model, magnetic disturbances arise solely from distortion of the spiral IMF by the bulk motion of CME material; embedded magnetic structures, such as magnetic clouds or flux ropes, are not considered. Numerical results show that the motion and appearance of a CME are affected by its interaction with the velocity and density structure of the background SW. This 3-D dynamic interaction also affects the orientation and magnitude of the IMF. Substantial excursions of the southward IMF component Bz are generated by three distinct mechanisms: shock compression of the IMF where the shock front is inclined to field lines, draping around the CME by mass flow convection, and distortion of the IMF by rarefaction waves trailing the CME. The geoeffectiveness of the disturbance depends on the initial position of the CME with respect to the streamer belt as well as on the position of Earth with respect to the pulse centerline.}

abstract = {Shematovich et al. recently showed plasma induced sputtering in Titan's atmosphere is a source of neutral nitrogen in Saturn's magnetosphere comparable to the photo-dissociation source. These sources form a toroidal nitrogen cloud roughly centered at Titan's orbital radius but gravitationally bound to Saturn. Once ionized, these particles contribute to Saturn's plasma. When Titan is inside Saturn's magnetopause, newly formed ions can diffuse inward becoming inner magnetospheric energetic nitrogen where they can sputter and be implanted into icy satellite surfaces. Our 3-D simulation produces the first consistent Titan generated N and N2 neutral clouds; solar UV radiation and magnetospheric plasma subject these particles to dissociation and ionization. The cloud morphologies and associated nitrogen plasma source rates are predicted in anticipation of Cassini data. Since the amount of molecular nitrogen ejected from Titan by photo-dissociation is small, molecular nitrogen ions detection by Cassini will be an indicator of atmospheric sputtering.}

  abstract={Measurements of the temperature and density structure of the solar corona provide critical constraints on theories of coronal heating. Unfortunately, the complexity of the solar atmosphere, observational uncertainties, and the limitations of current atomic calculations, particularly those for Fe, all conspire to make this task very difficult. A critical assessment of plasma diagnostics in the corona is essential to making progress on the coronal heating problem. In this paper, we present an analysis of temperature and density measurements above the limb in the quiet corona using new observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode . By comparing the Si and Fe emission observed with EIS we are able to identify emission lines that yield consistent emission measure distributions. With these data we find that the distribution of temperatures in the quiet corona above the limb is strongly peaked near 1 MK, consistent with previous studies. We also find, however, that there is a tail in the emission measure distribution that extends to higher temperatures. EIS density measurements from several density sensitive line ratios are found to be generally consistent with each other and with previous measurements in the quiet corona. Our analysis, however, also indicates that a significant fraction of the weaker emission lines observed in the EIS wavelength ranges cannot be understood with current atomic data.}
