\contentsline {subsection}{Replaced: \truncate {.3\textwidth }{, based on \textit {Cassini} MAG observations from 2004 to early 2011. Specifically in this study we use the perturbation signal associated with the southern hemisphere ($\Psi _\mathrm {S}$ in Figure\nobreakspace {}\ref {equinox:fig:CowleyTDdiagrams}), as this signal was at a similar or greater amplitude than the northern magnetic field perturbation signal for the period studied here \citep {andrews2012}. We consider the effect of this choice when interpreting our results later in this study. In particular in Table\nobreakspace {}\ref {equinox:table:fitparams} we consider how the observed phase difference between the northern and southern signals from \citet {andrews2012} influences our results, and at the end of Section\nobreakspace {}\ref {equinox:sec:mainresults} we investigate how our results may be affected by using the magnetic perturbation associated with the northern hemisphere instead of the southern. In addition in Chapter\nobreakspace {}\ref {chap:conclusions}, Section\nobreakspace {}\ref {conclusions:sec:perturbations} we discuss potential future work in which we could use both northern and southern perturbation information to develop this study further.}}{10}{equation.1.2.2}

\contentsline {subsection}{Added: \truncate {.3\textwidth }{ In addition, the single RMS value for each trajectory does not explicitly reveal how the goodness of fit varies for the different magnetic field components. In Figures\ref {equinox:fig:rev120in} and \ref {equinox:fig:rev121out} especially it can be seen that the difference between the FO and F\&B model predictions is very small except in the $B_\theta $ component, where the F\&B model predicts an overall lower magnitude as well as different phase of oscillations. This lower magnitude $B_\theta $ for the F\&B model is closer to the MAG data for these two passes, and therefore can reduce the overall RMS value even if the phasing of the oscillations does not agree exactly with the data. This is particularly apparent in Figure\nobreakspace {}\ref {equinox:fig:rev121out} where there appears to be a slight discrepancy in the phasing of the $B_\theta $ oscillations between the F\&B model and the data particularly at the beginning of the pass, and the F\&B model has a lower RMS value of \SI {0.53}{nT} compared to \SI {0.65}{nT} for the FO model. In order to try and quantify this more robustly one could investigate the RMS values for each magnetic field component separately; however as the FO and F\&B models predict such similar values for the $B_r$ and $B_phi$ components, this would likely simply reveal what has just been discussed and can be seen on inspection of the relevant figures, that the model agreement and RMS value for the $B_\theta $ component is sensitive to the overall magnitude of the model predictions as well as the amplitude and phase of oscillations. To investigate the goodness of fit for each magnetic field component in terms of the phasing specifically, the individual components could be fit separately with the FO and F\&B models to make independent estimates of the best fit parameters and corresponding uncertainties; however the model parameters would likely not be well constrained when fitting the models to a single component due to the reduced information available. In addition, the FO and F\&B models could be fit to different regions of passes rather than entire inbound or outbound trajectories, for example defined by small windows of radial distance. This may reveal how the behaviour of the magnetosphere changes on smaller timescales than individual trajectories and could be useful to investigate in future, along with other potential model improvements as discussed later in this thesis. }}{29}{figure.caption.15}
